# Logistic-Regression-Practical-Case-Study
This is a case-study course on Udemy, given for free by Hadelin de Ponteves. I have done the Python code alongside him, and also tried to do the same in R. 

I also include the dataset here. It is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and contains clinican and pathological records on breast cancer.
